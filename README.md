Hash implementation (Key-Value storage on Arrays)
=================================================

Implement of Hash functionality based on Arrays with a **hash function** sample and **collisions resolving**

Smoke
-----
```
git clone https://github.com/dmproger/hash_on_arrays.git
cd hash_on_arrays
bundle

rspec
```

bundle version is 2.4.7

Notes
-----
This testcase was given at [Workato](https://www.workato.com/) interview during live coding session (absolute useless format for checking developer skills, in my opinion).

Later, i rewrote it in a normal mode and make the code cool and compact as possible, just for fun
